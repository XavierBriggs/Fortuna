# Perp strategies (T5.B7): runtime seam, `prob_claims/v1` scalar claims + swappable scoring, and the perp_event_basis basis model

Status: design approved by the operator in the 2026-06-13 brainstorming session (the
load-bearing decisions — native-CRPS scalar scoring, the swappable `ScoringRule` layer,
the `PredictiveDistribution`/`RealizedOutcome` naming, the `settlement_mark` basis
forecast, "build what you need to be complete" — were made by the operator there); the
adversarial design critique (track-c-scalar-claims-design-critique-2026-06-13.md,
ACCEPT-WITH-CONDITIONS) is folded in (the A3 egress-seam must-fix is §2.5; watch-items
addressed). Build proceeds SLICE-BY-SLICE, each gate-clean. BUILD_PLAN T5.B7 is IN
PROGRESS (the `FundingWindow` kernel, 507b1ad, is done; this design covers the remaining
slices §5); no box is ticked until its slice lands gated.
Supersedes the "design-only" status of the scalar half of `signal-contract.md` §2/§5
(this note authorizes the scalar build, "scalar with the first scalar consumer" =
funding_forecast). Spec 5.11/5.15 + Section 6/11 govern; an adopted detail that the
spec leaves open is recorded here and folded into a spec touch-up if it proves
load-bearing.

## 0. Why these three together, and what's foundational

The operator's framing: design the scalar claim type once, because it is foundational
across **perps** (funding forecasts), **weather** (Aeolus temperature quantiles), and
**personas** (track E) — not a perps-only concern. The three seams are designed in one
pass because **funding_forecast exercises all three** (it is the first scalar consumer,
it rides the perp-data seam, and it shares the underlying with perp_event_basis), but
the scalar-belief section (§1) is written CONSUMER-AGNOSTIC so weather and personas
adopt it unchanged.

The cross-cutting reach is deliberate and is the point: §1 lives in `fortuna-cognition`
(types + scoring) + `fortuna-ledger` (storage), outside the perp domain; §2/§3 add perp
strategies in `fortuna-runner` + a `PerpTick` on the `fortuna-core` bus. Ownership and
sequencing are in §5.

## 1. Beliefs as `(PredictiveDistribution, RealizedOutcome)` + a swappable `ScoringRule`

The load-bearing decision (operator, 2026-06-13): score scalar forecasts **natively with
CRPS now** (not by fanning out to binary thresholds), and make the **scoring layer
swappable** so any piece can be optimized independently. The shape that delivers both:

### 1.1 Separate the durable facts from the score

A belief stores two things that never change once written:

- **`PredictiveDistribution`** — the predictive claim, by outcome shape (the
  `prob_claims/v1` shapes):
  - `Binary { p: f64 }`
  - `Categorical { bins: Vec<(Label, f64)> }`
  - `Scalar { quantiles: Vec<Quantile>, unit: String }` where `Quantile { q: f64, v: f64 }`.
  Validation (strict, deny-unknown-fields per major version): `q` strictly increasing in
  (0,1); `v` non-decreasing (no quantile crossing); ≥2 quantiles for scalar; all finite;
  binary `p` and categorical bin probs in [0,1] (bins sum within tolerance).
- **`RealizedOutcome`** — the realized result when the belief resolves:
  - `Binary { happened: bool }`
  - `Categorical { label: Label }`
  - `Scalar { value: f64 }` (the realized funding rate, the realized temperature).

Both are recorded IMMUTABLY. Re-stating the I-discipline: these are cognition-domain
forecast quantities, **never money** — `f64` is correct here exactly as `Brier`/`p` are
`f64` today (CLAUDE.md: "probabilities are f64 in cognition only"). When a forecast later
informs a perp ORDER, the conversion to `PerpPrice`/`Cents` happens at the gate/exec
boundary with the established rounding-against-us discipline, not in the belief.

### 1.2 `ScoringRule`: the swappable layer

```rust
pub trait ScoringRule {
    fn id(&self) -> &'static str;                          // e.g. "brier", "crps_pinball"
    fn applies_to(&self, kind: PredictiveKind) -> bool;    // which outcome shapes it scores
    fn score(&self, pred: &PredictiveDistribution, outcome: &RealizedOutcome)
        -> Result<f64, ScoreError>;                        // LOWER IS BETTER
}
```

First rules shipped as instances:

- **`BrierRule`** (binary): `(p − 1{happened})²`.
- **`CrpsPinballRule`** (scalar): the mean pinball/quantile loss over the provided
  quantiles, which IS the discretized CRPS — no CDF reconstruction:
  `pinball_q(y, v) = q·(y − v)` if `y ≥ v` else `(1 − q)·(v − y)`;
  `score = mean_k pinball_{q_k}(y, v_k)`. A proper scoring rule; lower is better. The
  single-quantile (median, q=0.5) degenerate case reduces to scaled absolute error
  `|y − v|/2` — the proper score for the median; it is NOT Brier's squared error (the two
  rules are distinct instances of the same swappable `ScoringRule`, not reductions of each
  other).

Adding a log-loss rule, a weighted-CRPS, a categorical Brier, etc. is a new `impl`, not a
schema change.

### 1.3 Scores are derived, re-computable, and rule-tagged

The ledger stores `(belief_id, rule_id) → score` rows over the immutable
`(PredictiveDistribution, RealizedOutcome)`. Consequences (the "optimize every piece"
payoff):

- **Swap** the production scorer per belief class by config (CRPS vs pinball vs log-score
  for scalar; Brier vs log-loss for binary) — history is untouched, because the score is
  just a function of the durable facts + a rule id.
- **Backtest** a scorer: re-run any `ScoringRule` over every resolved belief and compare,
  because the prediction and the realized outcome are the immutable facts. Several scorers
  run side by side, each its own `(belief_id, rule_id)` row.

### 1.4 Storage (fortuna-ledger)

A scalar-belief path PARALLEL to the existing binary `BeliefRow` (binary/categorical
beliefs are untouched in slice 1):

- `scalar_beliefs`: `belief_id`, `event_key`, `quantiles` JSONB, `unit`, `horizon`,
  `provenance` JSONB, `created_at`. **Append-only with the SAME DB-level trigger the
  binary tables carry** (I5; mirror the INSERT-only/no-UPDATE-no-DELETE trigger from the
  initial migration) — INSERT-only at the app layer too.
- scalar resolution: the realized `value`, written **exactly-once** over the resolution
  window — mirror `BeliefsRepo::resolve_and_score` (repos.rs:1056), which the repo enforces
  to be a single write per belief; the scalar resolver carries the identical guard so a
  belief is scored once.
- `belief_scores`: `(belief_id, rule_id, score, scored_at)` — append-only (same trigger);
  one row per (belief, rule). The binary path's inline `brier` column is "the BrierRule
  score" conceptually; it migrates onto `belief_scores` as a careful follow-up (slice 1
  does NOT rip out the working binary scoring under track A — it adds the trait + the
  scalar path, and provides `BrierRule` so the binary path can adopt it incrementally).
- One migration in `crates/fortuna-ledger/migrations/` (new tables + their append-only
  triggers; binary tables untouched).

### 1.5 Two producers, one type

- **External producers** (Aeolus weather, personas) emit `prob_claims/v1` scalar
  envelopes through the existing `Source` → `SignalEnvelope` path (signal-contract.md §2);
  the strict mapper turns the scalar outcome into a `PredictiveDistribution::Scalar`.
- **Internal deterministic forecasters** (funding_forecast) construct the
  `PredictiveDistribution::Scalar` directly — no envelope round-trip for internal data.
- Both land in the same `scalar_beliefs` store, scored by the same `CrpsPinballRule`. That
  is the "design once" result.

## 2. The perp-strategy runtime seam

Two facts force this section: perp prices are `PerpPrice` (type-separated from `Cents`),
and the `Strategy`/`Proposal`/`ProposedLeg`/`CoreHandle` framework is event-contract-
shaped. The seam threads perp data in WITHOUT bending those types.

### 2.1 Perp market data on the bus: `PerpTick`

A new typed `EventPayload` variant (the `fortuna-core` bus already invites "typed variants
added by the tasks that own them"):

```rust
PerpTick {
    venue: VenueId,
    market: MarketId,                // e.g. KXBTCPERP / KXBTCPERP1
    marks: PerpMarks,                // settlement + conservative (+ liquidation/reference avail.)
    funding: FundingObservation,     // the venue ESTIMATE (running TWAP) + next_funding_time + ref
}
```

`FundingObservation` carries the venue's recorded funding **estimate** (the running TWAP)
+ `next_funding_time` + `reference_price` (the CF Benchmarks index). The premium proxy is
then `PerpMarks.venue_settlement − FundingObservation.reference_price` — settlement comes
from `marks`, reference from `funding`, no field duplicated. **Grounded in the fixtures
(§4): every field is a verbatim recorded field** of the WS `ticker` frame +
`/funding_rates/estimate`. The live feed/recorder
publishes `PerpTick`s; the Sim/DST/paper harness injects them. A strategy reads them in
`on_event` — no `CoreHandle` surgery.

### 2.2 Two strategy archetypes

- **funding_forecast — belief-producer, zero-capital.** Consumes `PerpTick`s; forecasts
  the FINAL funding rate from the recorded estimate trajectory (see §2.3); emits a scalar
  `PredictiveDistribution` (quantiles over the next finalized funding rate) via a NEW
  additive egress seam (§2.5). NO `Proposal`, no perp execution path, no `Cents` impedance.
  It is the first scalar consumer and exercises §1 end-to-end. Stage = Sim; scored by
  `CrpsPinballRule` against the realized funding rate at `next_funding_time`.
- **perp_event_basis — trader.** Trades the event-contract BRACKET legs (`Cents`, the
  existing `Proposal` path) using the perp + funding as a price INPUT (§3). This fits the
  current trader plumbing with NO perp-execution surgery. A native perp-leg execution path
  is a separate, larger, explicitly-deferred item.

### 2.3 funding_forecast's input (refined by the fixture grounding, §4)

Raw 1-minute premiums are NOT recorded and the premium-index formula is venue-unpublished
(research §11). So:

- **Authoritative input: the recorded funding ESTIMATE** — which the venue defines as "the
  time-weighted average of the premium index over `[last_funding_time, now)`", i.e. the
  running TWAP itself. funding_forecast tracks the estimate across capture cycles and
  forecasts the final rate (the estimate projected to `next_funding_time`, finalized via
  `finalize_funding_rate`).
- **Secondary path: `FundingWindow` over a `settlement_mark − reference_price` premium
  proxy** — the already-built kernel (commit 507b1ad), fed an approximate premium (labeled
  approximate, since the exact formula is unpublished). Useful when premium-resolution data
  improves; not the primary number.
- The scalar `PredictiveDistribution`'s quantiles = the point forecast (central quantile)
  + a dispersion model that narrows as the window elapses (`FundingWindow::remaining()`).
  The exact dispersion shape is a rung-0 modelling choice, documented and unit-tested; it
  is the thing CRPS then measures and calibration refines.

### 2.5 The scalar-belief egress seam (must-fix A3 — `drain_beliefs()` is binary-only)

`Strategy::drain_beliefs()` returns `Vec<BeliefDraft>`, and `BeliefDraft`
(fortuna-cognition beliefs.rs) is `deny_unknown_fields` with a REQUIRED `p: f64`
validated strictly in (0,1) — it is BINARY-ONLY. A scalar `PredictiveDistribution`
CANNOT flow through it, and (per the design's own "binary path untouched, no track-A
collision" constraint) it must NOT be widened. So scalar egress is a NEW ADDITIVE seam:

- a new `Strategy` trait method `drain_scalar_beliefs(&mut self) -> Vec<ScalarBeliefDraft>`
  (default `Vec::new()`, so every existing strategy is unaffected — same additive shape
  `drain_beliefs()` itself uses);
- a parallel runner buffer that drains it each tick (mirroring the binary
  `drain_pending_beliefs` path);
- a parallel daemon persist into `scalar_beliefs` + `belief_scores` (mirroring the binary
  `persist_beliefs`), append-only + audited.

`ScalarBeliefDraft` carries `{event_key, predictive: PredictiveDistribution::Scalar,
horizon, evidence}` — the scalar analog of `BeliefDraft`, the harness stamping provenance.
This is the ONLY correct §1 mechanism; the doc previously mis-named it `drain_beliefs()`.

### 2.4 Files touched

New files in `fortuna-runner` (`funding_forecast.rs`, `perp_event_basis.rs`) + the
`PerpTick` variant in `fortuna-core` bus + the basis kernel in `fortuna-core` perp + the
`drain_scalar_beliefs()` method on the `fortuna-runner` `Strategy` trait (§2.5). All
additive (default-impl trait method; new files). TWO shared touch-points to coordinate
with track A (§5): the `Strategy`-trait scalar drain method AND registering the strategies
in the daemon composition (`fortuna-live`) — neither rewrites track A's existing files.

## 3. The basis model (perp_event_basis)

Two surfaces on the same underlying (BTC), same venue family, same CF Benchmarks
reference, ZERO cross-venue settlement/latency risk:

- **Perp side — the point forecast of the fixing**: `settlement_mark_price` (operator-
  delegated choice; the mark the venue itself uses for settlement AND funding — the most
  defensible single number, already embodying the venue's premium handling). The funding-
  adjusted refinement (project the premium decay over the bracket horizon using
  funding_forecast's output) is a clean LATER synergy — rung-0 uses the mark directly.
- **Bracket side — the implied distribution**: the **KXBTC** event-contract ladder (CORRECTED
  2026-06-13 against the live capture — see GAPS "LIVE BRACKET-FORMAT INVESTIGATION"). KXBTC is the
  price-LEVEL ladder: `strike_type=between` range bins (e.g. "$74,500 to 74,999.99") plus open
  `greater`/`less` tails, YES quoted in dollar-strings on a $1 payout. Its central estimate is the
  implied median (the strike where cumulative implied probability crosses 0.5). NOTE: KXBTC15M
  (this section's original guess) is NOT this — it is a single DIRECTIONAL "BTC up in 15 min?"
  binary (`greater_or_equal`, floor=reference price), a P(up) not a price distribution; KXBTCD is a
  cumulative-threshold (CDF) ladder.

### 3.1 Signal + trade (deterministic, mechanical, rung-0)

- `basis = perp_forecast − bracket_implied_median`.
- Tradeable when `|basis|` exceeds BOTH a configured threshold (underlying price units)
  AND the round-trip bracket fees at the FEE-TRAP rate (assumed post-promo fees; promo-$0
  never justifies GO; amendment C). I7 unchanged.
- **Trade the bracket legs** (`Cents`), maker-only, toward the perp forecast — buy the
  brackets the perp says are underpriced. Worst-case loss = premium (event contracts), so
  the existing gate caps apply; NO perp/margin leg in rung-0.
- Stage = Sim; the harness sizes (I6). The basis math is a deterministic kernel in
  `fortuna-cognition` (`basis.rs` — f64-forecast, NOT core, per the money-discipline), unit-tested
  with synthetic ladders + perp forecasts. Slice 3b (DONE) refined the kernel to the REAL
  3-strike-type ladder: a `BracketStrike` enum {`Between`{floor,cap}, `Greater`{floor},
  `Less`{cap}} with `BracketBin{kind, prob: f64}`; the median INTERPOLATES within the crossing
  `between` bin and returns `None` when the 0.5 crossing lands in an OPEN tail (no finite width —
  conservative, no fabricated point). The dollar-string→probability parse is the CALLER's boundary
  (the kernel takes the `f64` mid, staying format-agnostic), and `compute_basis` takes the perp
  mark as caller-supplied `f64` BTC-dollars — the kernel has ZERO money-type touch (the
  per-contract→BTC ×10000 boundary is the caller's). The real-KXBTC e2e (`basis_live_fixture.rs`)
  now drives it on the committed paired cycle (§3.2). The sized `Cents` bracket-leg TRADE (the
  strategy) is the remaining fixture-gated step.

### 3.2 The live-data drive (the fixture unblock)

The recorder on the main checkout pairs perp books with **KXBTC** bracket quotes by `cycle_id` in
`data/perishable/<day>/{perp_orderbook,bracket_quotes}.jsonl` — CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-06-13 (the
recorder runs `--bracket-series KXBTC15M,KXBTC,KXBTCD`; the KXBTC `between` ladder IS being
captured). The perp side is fixture-gated; the KXBTC bracket side is not yet a committed fixture.
To make perp_event_basis fixtures-gated end-to-end (now drivable by me, operator-directed):

- Sample ONE paired cycle (matching `cycle_id`: a perp book + marks + the KXBTC `between`-ladder
  bracket quotes) into a committed `fixtures/kinetics-perps/` file (market data ONLY, no keys),
  **reading the existing perishable stream, WITHOUT touching the running recorder** (loop rule).
  DONE: `fixtures/kinetics-perps/derived/paired_cycle_btc_perp_vs_kxbtc.json` (cycle
  1781160753775; 48 `between` + 1 `greater` + 1 `less`). It lives under `derived/` because it is
  a recorder-DERIVED pair, not a single Kinetics DTO capture — the top-level `kinetics_dto`
  coverage glob (non-recursive) must not require it to parse as a venue DTO.
- The basis KERNEL (deterministic) does not block on it; both the fixture and the kernel
  KXBTC-tail refinement (slice 3b) have LANDED, so `basis_live_fixture.rs` now drives the kernel
  end-to-end on real co-recorded data. The STRATEGY (the sized `Cents` bracket-leg trade) is the
  remaining fixture-gated step.

## 4. Fixture grounding (confirmed 2026-06-13 against `fixtures/kinetics-perps/` + the recorder)

- **`PerpTick` — fully grounded.** The WS `ticker` frame carries `settlement_mark_price`,
  `liquidation_mark_price`, `reference_price` (each `{price, ts_ms}`) and `funding_rate
  {rate, next_funding_time_ms, ts_ms}`; `/funding_rates/estimate` carries `{funding_rate,
  mark_price, next_funding_time}`. `PerpMarks` + `FundingObservation` map 1:1. No invention.
- **funding premiums — NOT recorded.** The estimate (running TWAP) is the authoritative
  input; the `mark − reference` proxy is the labeled secondary (§2.3).
- **basis paired data — perp side fixture-gated; bracket side live-perishable only.** The
  live-data drive (§3.2) samples a committed paired-cycle fixture; the bracket-fixture gap
  is the operator/recorder unblock if the stream lacks brackets.

## 5. Ownership + sequencing

This is an OPERATOR-DIRECTED cross-cutting build (the operator's design directive
transcends the per-track loop's crate partition). It spans `fortuna-cognition` +
`fortuna-ledger` (the scalar foundation), `fortuna-runner` (the strategies),
`fortuna-core` (PerpTick + basis kernel). Track C owns it as ONE effort with the
operator-granted expanded scope, building ADDITIVELY (new files + default-impl trait
methods), and coordinating FILE-LEVEL with neighbors. TWO shared touch-points on
track-A-adjacent files to coordinate (neither rewrites track A's existing logic): (i) the
`drain_scalar_beliefs()` method on the `fortuna-runner` `Strategy` trait (§2.5), and (ii)
registering the strategies in the daemon composition (`fortuna-live`). Track D coordinates
if/when Aeolus adopts the scalar `prob_claims/v1` (the mapper is shared). Every slice is
independently gate-clean with the full battery.

**Build sequence (each its own gate-clean iteration + battery):**

1. **Scalar belief foundation** — `PredictiveDistribution` / `RealizedOutcome` /
   `ScoringRule` + `BrierRule` + `CrpsPinballRule` (cognition); `scalar_beliefs` +
   `belief_scores` + scalar resolution + one migration (ledger). Tests: pinball/CRPS
   vectors + proper-scoring properties, quantile validation, re-scoring determinism,
   storage round-trip. (Self-contained; no perp dependency.)
2. **funding_forecast** — `PerpTick` variant (fortuna-core bus) + the strategy
   (fortuna-runner) consuming `PerpTick`s → scalar `PredictiveDistribution` from the
   estimate (FundingWindow proxy secondary); standalone strategy tests + a perp DST arm
   (belief production under funding-tick chaos). First scalar consumer end-to-end.
3. **perp_event_basis** — the basis kernel (fortuna-core perp, deterministic, synthetic-
   input tests) + the live-data fixture drive (§3.2) + the bracket-trader strategy
   (fortuna-runner, bracket legs) + a fixtures-gated end-to-end test once the paired-cycle
   fixture lands.
4. **Daemon composition** — register both strategies into the Sim runner (coordinate with
   track A); confirm they run in a Sim soak.

Phase-5 EXIT (T5.B7) completes when 1–4 land gated. T5.B8 (perps ops) remains a separate
queue item with its own kill-switch-collision coordination (out of scope here).

## 6. What this deliberately does NOT do (YAGNI)

- No native perp-leg trading (perp_event_basis trades brackets; perp legs are a later,
  larger item).
- No scorecard export (the Aeolus-as-API product; v2, after a second consumer).
- No binary-path rewrite (binary adopts `ScoringRule`/`belief_scores` as a careful
  follow-up, not a slice-1 prerequisite).
- No funding_carry strategy (DATA-ONLY until ≥60d funding history, amendment B).
- No streaming/bus transport for external claims (batch envelopes suffice at trigger
  cadence, per signal-contract.md §4).

## 7. Testing + invariants

- **Scalar scoring**: pinball/CRPS property tests (a sharper-correct forecast scores
  lower; symmetry; the degenerate 1-quantile case; a real recorded funding rate as a
  vector), strict-parse/validation tests from the spec text (quantile monotonicity, bin
  sums), re-scoring determinism + multi-rule side-by-side.
- **funding_forecast**: belief-production tests against the recorded estimate trajectory;
  a DST arm (beliefs produced + scored under tick/gap chaos; determinism).
- **perp_event_basis**: basis-kernel unit tests (synthetic ladders + perp forecasts,
  threshold + fee-trap boundaries); fixtures-gated end-to-end once the paired cycle lands;
  the fee-trap edge floor enforced.
- **Invariants**: I6 (both archetypes PROPOSE; the harness sizes — funding_forecast
  proposes nothing, perp_event_basis proposes unsized bracket legs); I7 (Sim stage, no
  auto-promotion, the fee-trap gate on GO); I5 (every belief/score write audited);
  money/forecast boundary (scalar `f64` is forecast-quality, never money — the
  PerpPrice/Cents conversion stays at the gate/exec edge).

## 8. Telemetry (rich, slots into the existing metrics, extensible by construction)

The repo's telemetry grain (spec §8) is the **named `MetricSample`** (`runner.rs`:
`{name: &'static str, help, counter: bool, labels: Vec<(String,String)>, value: i64}`),
which the runner emits and the ops layer maps into `fortuna_ops::metrics::MetricsRegistry`
→ the `GET /metrics` endpoint. The runner stays telemetry-dependency-free; the ops layer
owns the registry. **We slot in by EMITTING new named samples — no struct field added to
the shared `StrategyMetrics`/`RunCounters`, no schema migration.** That IS the
extensibility property: a new metric, a new producer, a new scorer is a new
`(name, labels, value)` tuple, nothing else.

**Dimensional scheme (labels do the work, so expansion never forks the schema):**

- Scalar-belief lifecycle (producer-agnostic — funding_forecast now, Aeolus/personas
  later, identical metric, new `producer` label value):
  - `fortuna_scalar_beliefs_emitted_total{producer}` (counter)
  - `fortuna_scalar_beliefs_resolved_total{producer}` (counter)
- Scoring/calibration (labeled by `rule_id`, so swapping or A/B-ing scorers is visible —
  the `ScoringRule` swappability surfaced in telemetry):
  - `fortuna_scalar_score{producer, rule_id}` (gauge: rolling mean score, lower-better;
    e.g. rolling-N CRPS)
  - `fortuna_scalar_quantile_coverage{producer, band}` (gauge: realized fraction inside
    the e.g. 0.1–0.9 band ×10⁴ — calibration at a glance)
- funding_forecast: `fortuna_funding_forecast_rate{market}` (gauge, point forecast ×10⁶),
  `fortuna_funding_window_elapsed{market}` (gauge, candles observed).
- perp_event_basis: `fortuna_perp_basis{market}` (gauge, signed basis in underlying
  ten-thousandths), `fortuna_perp_basis_signals_total{market}` (counter, tradeable
  inconsistencies past the fee-trap floor); proposals/fills ride the existing
  `StrategyMetrics`.

**Value encoding** (the registry is `i64`): floats are fixed-point-scaled with the scale
named in `help` (rate ×10⁶, basis in ten-thousandths, coverage ×10⁴) — the same
integer-telemetry discipline the existing counters use; no `f64` enters the registry.
The scalar score gauges read off the durable `belief_scores` rows (§1.3), so they are
re-derivable and consistent with the ledger, not a parallel truth.

## 9. ROTA views (track-B can build these in the meantime — read-only spec)

ROTA is track-B's (`fortuna-ops/src/rota/`), read-only doctrine ABSOLUTE: zero mutating
endpoints, gold-on-black tokens, per-panel degraded state (HTTP 200, never 500), a
SEPARATE read-only pool (never the daemon's), `GET /api/rota/v1/<view>` snapshot JSON +
short-poll. This section is the **view CONTRACT** track-B builds against; track C ships
the data (the `scalar_beliefs`/`belief_scores` tables, slice 1b) the queries read. Track B
can build the panels + degraded states NOW against these contracts; they light up when the
data lands. (This refines the design's already-deferred "perps/funding-regime panel".)

### 9.1 `GET /api/rota/v1/forecasts` — the scalar-forecast SCORECARD (producer-agnostic, the headline)

The view that "shows the outcomes of the perps vendor and the whole process," generalized:
one row per `producer` (funding_forecast, and later aeolus/personas with ZERO view
change). Per producer:
- the recent scalar beliefs: the quantile fan (e.g. 0.1/0.5/0.9), `unit`, `horizon`,
  `event_key`, and the realized `value` once resolved (the forecast-vs-outcome pair —
  the heart of "did the vendor call it");
- the calibration summary: rolling mean score PER `rule_id` (swappable scorers shown
  side by side — Brier-of-binarized vs CRPS, when more than one runs), quantile-band
  coverage (is the 0.1–0.9 band ~80%?), resolved-N;
- a sparkline-ready series of (issued_at, median, realized) for the recent window.
This is the "publish claims, receive calibration-vs-market scorecards" product surface
(signal-contract.md §3), now operator-facing. View JSON: `{producers: [{producer,
calibration: {rule_scores: [{rule_id, mean, resolved_n}], coverage_bps, ...},
recent: [{event_key, issued_at, quantiles, horizon, realized, status}]}], degraded?}`.

### 9.2 `GET /api/rota/v1/perps` — funding regime + basis (perps-specific)

- Funding regime: current funding estimate + `next_funding_time` per market, the
  funding_forecast point+band, and recent realized funding rates (the regime trail) —
  the venue's funding world at a glance.
- Basis: per market, the current `basis = perp_forecast − bracket_median`, the recent
  basis trail, and the basis-signal events (tradeable inconsistencies) with their trade
  outcomes (proposed → gated → filled/rejected → settled PnL) — the perp_event_basis
  story end to end.

### 9.3 "The whole process" — lineage, woven into 9.1/9.2

Rather than a separate panel, each scorecard/basis row is CLICK-TO-EXPAND to its lineage
(the cognition-panel pattern, rota-dashboard.md §5): `PerpTick` ingest → forecast →
scalar belief (provenance) → score (per rule) → realized outcome → (for basis) the
bracket trade + settlement. One honest thread from input to outcome, no new storage (the
provenance + belief_scores rows already carry it).

**Extensibility for track B**: every view is keyed by `producer`/`market` labels, so a new
scalar producer or a new perp market is a new row/series, not a new panel or contract
change — the same zero-schema-change property as §8.

## 10. Why expanding this is trivial (the extensibility principles, made explicit)

Each foundational choice is a SEAM that absorbs the next consumer without a rewrite:

1. **Swappable `ScoringRule`** — a new score (log-loss, weighted-CRPS, a market-relative
   skill score) is one `impl` + its `belief_scores` rows; nothing else moves. Scorers run
   side by side and are backtestable over the immutable `(PredictiveDistribution,
   RealizedOutcome)` facts.
2. **Producer-agnostic scalar type** — funding_forecast, Aeolus weather, and track-E
   personas all emit `PredictiveDistribution::Scalar`; onboarding consumer N+1 is a
   `producer` label + (for external vendors) a registry row, not new Rust (signal-contract
   §3's "an hour, not an afternoon").
3. **Named-sample telemetry** — a new metric/producer/scorer is a new `(name, labels,
   value)` tuple; no shared struct grows, no migration.
4. **Producer-/market-keyed ROTA views** — a new producer or market is a new row/series in
   the existing contracts; track B never re-cuts a panel.
5. **Additive seams everywhere** — `drain_scalar_beliefs()` is a default-impl trait method;
   `PerpTick` is a new bus variant; `scalar_beliefs`/`belief_scores` are new tables beside
   the untouched binary path. Each addition is orthogonal to what exists.

The test of the design: adding "a second weather vendor" or "a persona forecaster" or "a
new perp market" or "a sharper scoring rule" should each touch ONE seam and zero schemas.
By construction here, each does.
