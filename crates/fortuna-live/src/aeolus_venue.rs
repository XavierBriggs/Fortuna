//! F7 (Track-A half): the Aeolus↔Kalshi bucket seam — the venue-facing glue
//! that turns a recorded Kalshi temperature-bracket book into FORTUNA weather
//! beliefs + market-event edges.
//!
//! Three deterministic, pure helpers (no `Clock`, no IO, no panic):
//!
//! 1. [`station_series`] — the GROUNDED NWS-station → Kalshi-series map. Only
//!    `(KNYC, tmax) → KXHIGHNY` is confirmed against recorded data; other
//!    cities are intentionally absent until their station↔city pairing is
//!    confirmed (returning `None` is the conservative default).
//! 2. [`market_to_bucket`] — applies the grounded venue→`BucketKind` mapping
//!    (contract: `floor`/`cap` strikes → in-range/tail kinds). PURE kind
//!    derivation: it does NOT filter on market status; the active-only filter
//!    is the CALLER's concern, so a test can build buckets from a settled
//!    day-set. An absent/non-integer strike or unknown `strike_type` → `None`.
//! 3. [`aeolus_bucket_edges`] — runs the Track-E belief matcher
//!    ([`aeolus_bucket_beliefs`]) over a discovered bucket set and emits, 1:1
//!    and order-preserving, one auto-confirmed `Direct` [`EdgeProposal`] per
//!    belief draft.
//!
//! ## Why auto-confirm the edges here (spec §5.12 + I1/I6 reconciliation)
//!
//! These edges are EXACT-bucket matches: a single Kalshi market and a single
//! Aeolus bucket are the *same* `Direct` proposition by construction (the
//! belief's `event_id` IS `aeolus:{ticker}`). §5.12 reserves human-confirmed
//! edges for the cross-venue / multi-leg equivalence risk (the UMA failure
//! mode); a deterministic in-venue `Direct` 1:1 carries none of that risk, so
//! it is auto-confirmed (`confirmed_by = "discovery:auto"`). This does NOT
//! weaken any invariant: the belief stays propose-only (I6 — the model never
//! sized, timed, or routed it), and any resulting order still crosses the same
//! deterministic gate pipeline (I1) on the operator-gated `kalshi` venue. The
//! edge only makes the belief *tradeable*; it authorizes nothing on its own.
//!
//! NOTHING here is wired into `drive()` — the parent owns the live discovery
//! plug-in. This module is the recorded-fixture-tested machinery only.
