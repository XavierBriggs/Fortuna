# ASSUMPTIONS.md (agent-maintained)

Every decision made where docs/spec.md is silent: what was assumed, why it is the
conservative option, and the spec section it interprets.

## T0.2 — deterministic bus + replay

- **Recorded time is authoritative during replay.** The replayer drives a fresh
  SimClock from each recorded event's stamp before dispatching it, instead of
  trying to reproduce the original harness's clock-advance pattern. Spec 5.1
  requires byte-identical replay but is silent on clock reconstruction; this is
  the conservative reading (replay can never falsely diverge because of clock
  bookkeeping, and a corrupt recording with backwards stamps fails loudly).
- **Fail-closed handler-error semantics, pinned by test:** a handler error stops
  dispatch immediately, the erroring handler's pending publishes are discarded,
  the failing event remains in the recording (audit truth: it WAS dispatched),
  and the bus error is fatal to the run (the runner halts; no resume API).
  Spec 5.1/Section 9 imply fail-closed but don't specify outbox disposition;
  discarding is conservative (no half-processed derived state).
- **`EventPayload` starts with only a `Raw{kind,data}` variant.** Typed variants
  are added by the tasks that own them (venue events in T0.3, gate verdicts in
  T0.5, ...). Conservative: inventing the full event taxonomy now would
  pre-commit downstream contracts the spec assigns to later sections.
- **Handler ids are unique per bus** (subscribe rejects duplicates): event
  origin attribution and replay identity depend on stable, unambiguous ids.

## T0.1 — fortuna-core foundations

- **Timestamp precision is fixed at milliseconds** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ`),
  truncated at construction. Spec/conventions say "UTC ISO8601" but are silent on
  precision. Fixed precision makes serialization byte-identical (replay/audit
  determinism is load-bearing, spec 5.1/I5), and ULIDs are millisecond-granular, so
  nothing in the system can act on finer time anyway. Truncating at construction
  (rather than at serialization) guarantees the in-memory value always equals its
  wire form.
- **SimClock is monotone non-decreasing**; `set()` backwards is an error and
  `advance`/`set` leave time unchanged on error. Spec is silent on sim-clock
  semantics. Conservative because replay determinism assumes a forward-only sim
  time; a test that needs backwards time must model it explicitly (e.g. venue
  timestamp skew as data, not as the injected clock).
- **Id generation uses an in-house SplitMix64 PRNG** (pinned by published test
  vectors) instead of the `rand` crate. Spec is silent on the PRNG. `rand`'s small
  RNGs make no cross-version/cross-platform byte-stability promise, and id
  determinism feeds the bus/audit/replay chain; owning 10 lines of pinned PRNG is
  the conservative option.
- **IdGen monotonicity policy** (ULID spec interpretation): within one millisecond
  the 80-bit random part increments; if the injected clock reads backwards, the
  generator clamps to its high-water-mark millisecond (ids never duplicate or
  reorder); pre-1970 or >= 2^48 ms timestamps are errors; random-part exhaustion
  within one millisecond is an error, never a silent wrap. Erroring over wrapping
  is conservative: a wrap would silently break id ordering, which downstream
  consumers (audit, journal) are allowed to rely on.
