# ASSUMPTIONS.md (agent-maintained)

Every decision made where docs/spec.md is silent: what was assumed, why it is the
conservative option, and the spec section it interprets.

## T0.1 — fortuna-core foundations

- **Timestamp precision is fixed at milliseconds** (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ`),
  truncated at construction. Spec/conventions say "UTC ISO8601" but are silent on
  precision. Fixed precision makes serialization byte-identical (replay/audit
  determinism is load-bearing, spec 5.1/I5), and ULIDs are millisecond-granular, so
  nothing in the system can act on finer time anyway. Truncating at construction
  (rather than at serialization) guarantees the in-memory value always equals its
  wire form.
- **SimClock is monotone non-decreasing**; `set()` backwards is an error and
  `advance`/`set` leave time unchanged on error. Spec is silent on sim-clock
  semantics. Conservative because replay determinism assumes a forward-only sim
  time; a test that needs backwards time must model it explicitly (e.g. venue
  timestamp skew as data, not as the injected clock).
- **Id generation uses an in-house SplitMix64 PRNG** (pinned by published test
  vectors) instead of the `rand` crate. Spec is silent on the PRNG. `rand`'s small
  RNGs make no cross-version/cross-platform byte-stability promise, and id
  determinism feeds the bus/audit/replay chain; owning 10 lines of pinned PRNG is
  the conservative option.
- **IdGen monotonicity policy** (ULID spec interpretation): within one millisecond
  the 80-bit random part increments; if the injected clock reads backwards, the
  generator clamps to its high-water-mark millisecond (ids never duplicate or
  reorder); pre-1970 or >= 2^48 ms timestamps are errors; random-part exhaustion
  within one millisecond is an error, never a silent wrap. Erroring over wrapping
  is conservative: a wrap would silently break id ordering, which downstream
  consumers (audit, journal) are allowed to rely on.
